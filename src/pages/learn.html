  <li class="list-group-item">AI-Powered Writing Feedback System</li>
    <p>Introducing the AI-powered writing feedback system - the revolutionary solution for improving student writing skills while saving time on grading. This system uses natural language processing (NLP) algorithms to provide personalized feedback to students in areas such as grammar, sentence structure, and word choice. With over 100 essays to grade each week, traditional grading methods can be overwhelming for teachers. That's where the AI-powered writing feedback system comes in - it analyzes student essays and provides suggestions for improvement, freeing up valuable time for teachers to provide individualized attention to students in other areas. This cutting-edge technology encourages student engagement and allows for a more personalized learning experience. So why not join the many educators who are already using this system to enhance their teaching practices and improve student outcomes?</p><br>
    <ul>
        <li>Teachers can provide students with a writing prompt and have them submit their essays online. The AI system can then analyze the essays and provide personalized feedback to each student.</li>
        <li>The system can be integrated into existing learning management systems, such as Canvas or Blackboard, making it easy for teachers to assign and grade student essays.</li>
        <li>Students can access their feedback online and review their work at their own pace. This allows them to identify areas for improvement and track their progress over time.</li>
        <li>Teachers can use the system to identify common writing errors and tailor their lessons to address these issues.</li>
        <li>The AI system can also be used to provide feedback on other types of writing assignments, such as lab reports or research papers.</li>
        <li>The system can be customized to align with specific curriculums or learning objectives, ensuring that students receive feedback that is relevant and meaningful.</li>

  <li class="list-group-item">How to use Github</li>
    <p>GitHub is a platform for software developers to collaborate, manage and store their code. Here are some basic steps to get started with using GitHub:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Create a GitHub account:</b> Go to the GitHub website and create an account by providing your email address and a strong password.</li>
        <li><b>Create a new repository:</b> A repository is a storage space where your code will be stored. Click on the "+" sign in the top right corner of your dashboard and select "New repository." Give your repository a name and a brief description.</li>
        <li><b>Clone your repository:</b> Cloning your repository creates a local copy of your code on your computer. To do this, go to your repository page and click on the green "Code" button. Copy the HTTPS link and use it to clone the repository using a Git client like Git Bash or GitHub Desktop.</li>
        <li><b>Add and commit changes:</b> Once you have cloned the repository, you can make changes to the code and commit those changes to your local copy. This creates a checkpoint in your development process and allows you to track changes over time.</li>
        <li><b>Push changes to your repository:</b> After you have committed changes to your local copy, you can push those changes to your remote repository on GitHub. Use the Git client to push the changes using the command "git push origin main" or by clicking on the "Push" button in GitHub Desktop.</li>
        <li><b>Create pull requests:</b> If you are working on a project with others, you can create a pull request to ask for their feedback on your changes. This allows them to review your code and suggest any changes or improvements.</li>
    </ul><br>
  <li class="list-group-item">How to use Docker</li>
    <p>Docker is a platform for building, shipping, and running applications in containers. Containers are lightweight, portable, and self-contained environments that include all the necessary dependencies and libraries for an application to run.Here is a general overview of the steps to use Docker:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Install Docker:</b> Download and install Docker Desktop for your operating system. Docker Desktop includes all the necessary tools to create and run containers.</li>
        <li><b>Build a Docker image:</b> A Docker image is a snapshot of an application and all its dependencies. You can create a Docker image using a Dockerfile, which is a script that contains instructions on how to build an image. Once you have a Dockerfile, you can run the "docker build" command to build the image.</li>
        <li><b>Run a container:</b> Once you have a Docker image, you can run a container using the "docker run" command. Running a container creates an instance of the image and allows you to interact with the application inside the container.</li>
        <li><b>Manage containers:</b> You can manage Docker containers using various commands, such as "docker ps" to list running containers, "docker stop" to stop a container, or "docker rm" to remove a container.</li>
        <li><b>Use Docker Compose:</b> Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It allows you to define the services that make up an application and how they interact with each other. You can use a YAML file to define the services and then run them using the "docker-compose up" command.</li>
